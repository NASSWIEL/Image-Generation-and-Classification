### Project Overview
 This repository contains the work from a collaborative final semester project for a bachelor's degree, completed by a team of four students. The primary objective of the project was to explore deep learning techniques for image classification and generation, with a focus on supervised learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced generative models.

 ### Objectives and Achievements
* **Image Classification**: We implemented CNNs to classify images (e.g., distinguishing tigers from non-tigers). To address the challenge of a limited dataset, we utilized image data augmentation techniques to enhance our training set. Furthermore, we incorporated transfer learning, adapting models like ResNet to improve classification accuracy.

* **Image Generation**: The project also delved into image generation technologies. We started with autoencoders to perform tasks such as noise reduction and image coloring. Subsequent experiments involved Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating new images via manipulation of the latent space. Lastly, we explored Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create more complex images.

* **Learning and Development**: Throughout this project, our focus was on evaluating and optimizing models, including hyperparameter tuning, and on developing robust predictive models. Although the visual quality of the images we generated did not rival that of commercial tools like Dale-E, our work laid a solid foundation for understanding and applying deep learning principles to real-world challenges.
